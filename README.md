# HackTheBuild 2.0 ðŸ’»
**Team:** LogiBlock

**Problem Statement:** "Blockchain for Improving the Efficiency of Defense Logistics and Supply Chain Operations."

TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM FOR LOGISTIC AND INVENTORY MANAGEMENT THAT USES BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY, INSTEAD OF TRADITIONAL METHODS. THE SYSTEM SHOULD MANAGE THE TRACING AND TRACKING OF DEFENSE ASSETS IN A SYSTEMATIC MANNER PROVIDING SECURE DECENTRALIZED LEDGER USING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY.

**Tech Stack:** Ethereum Smart Contarct, ReactJs, Web3Js, Solidity, Metamask, JS

**Proposed Soltion**

An Inventory and Logistic Management Web based application using Blockchain and Smart Contacts :
* The flow of assets in the inventory is secured thorough a Smart Contract using wallet transactions on ethereum network. 
* The system will store details like Quantity, Manufacturer, Type etc. for each specific asset in the inventory.
* The web application enables user to manage the inventory by adding and updating the assets.
* For each change in asset condition, a transaction gets created and stored over blockchain.
* Real-Time Tracking helps in accessing and handling all the inventory items.

**This project has been Designed & Developed at IIT Jammu by Rutvik Gupta, Surabhi Gupta and Shubham Gaur for HacktheBuild 2.0
